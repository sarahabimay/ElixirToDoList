# Elixir To Do List

Welcome to My "To Do List' exercise!
It is just a first exercise so the to do list tasks are not persisted at the moment.
You can 1) Add 2) Edit 3) Delete Task as you wish!

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed as:

  1. Add todo to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

        def deps do
          [{:todo, "~> 0.0.1"}]
        end

  2. Ensure todo is started before your application:

        def application do
          [applications: [:todo]]
        end


## Running the App
  1. git clone the repo
  2. navigate to the ElxirToDoList/todo directory
  3. run ```./todo``` and you're away..
